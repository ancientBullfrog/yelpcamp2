# yelpcamp2
Update to original functionality from the Web Development Bootcamp

Demo site available here; https://mywifemademejoin-yelpcamp2.herokuapp.com/

Original functionality used CRUD to manage campsite data and introduced various third party software such as Cloudinary and Mapbox.

This version adds a few features to the base YelpCamp created in the course. These features are as follows:
- Added Search to home page
- added search to map
- added basic user profile where passsword can be updated
- added forgot password with email reset link vai node mailer
- added pagination to index page

Current issues are:
- using geo-location search input on the map does not update the list of campsites
- campsites on map are restricted to current pageination page.
